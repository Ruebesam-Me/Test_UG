Home","icon":"","description":"The MOSAIC Assessment Tool is a software package that can be used to support assessments of national systems and practices for the control of small arms and light weapons (SALW). It is a portable, offline desktop application that contains a repository of assessment criteria based on the Modular Small-arms-control Implementation Compendium (MOSAIC). It helps users who want to conduct an assessment of a national SALW control system with:\nDesigning an assessment checklist\nCollecting assessment data\nEvaluating the collected data\nThe Assessment Tool is free to use. It does not require installation and can be executed without administrator rights. It runs on Windows 10 operating systems or newer. It should also run on Windows 7 and 8 operating systems, but there might be some limitations. The Assessment Tool has no online or cloud-based functions – you have full control over where any data that you input into the Assessment Tool is saved. The Assessment Tool, which was developed by the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR) in collaboration with the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (UNODA), is currently available in Arabic, English, French and Spanish. You can download the Assessment Tool here: This User Guide contains practical guidance to help you use the Assessment Tool and all its functions.

A national SALW control system comprises a range of measures at the strategic, regulatory and operational levels to ensure that the designated national authorities can control SALW throughout their life cycle, from production to destruction. Every Member State is expected to establish and maintain a national SALW control system to implement the UN Programme of Action on SALW (PoA). At the same time, each Member State exercises national sovereignty in determining how to establish and maintain its national system. In response to requests by Member States for assistance from the United Nations to establish and maintain their systems, the United Nations Coordination Action on Small Arms (CASA) platform created MOSAIC.The MOSAIC Assessment Tool was launched in 2025 to support assessments, based on MOSAIC, of national SALW control systems. It is based on a recognition that there is no single approach for a national SALW control system nor a single type of assessment. Its purpose it to help design and conduct assessments that fit your specific assessment needs.Assessments are a useful way for States to get a clear picture of the strengths and weaknesses of the national SALW control system (i.e., what is working well and what is not). They offer a structured approach to finding and analysing issues in the SALW control system. Using the findings of an assessment, stakeholders can then identify and implement measures to address any weaknesses. This could, for instance, include changes to national legislation or regulations, improvements to SALW control infrastructure such as recordkeeping databases, or targeted requests for international cooperation and assistance. Assessments can also help determine whether implemented improvements have had the desired effects, enabling stakeholders to make further adjustments and strengthen their SALW control efforts.<img src=\"images/assessment-flow-chart.png\" target=\"_self\">The Assessment Tool allows you to select assessment criteria based on MOSAIC provisions from covered MOSAIC modules. In this way you can create tailored assessment checklists to support a comprehensive evaluation of a national SALW control system or particular elements in such a system. The Assessment Tool then allows you to enter the data collected for your assessment into your checklist, which is used to evaluate the national SALW control system.The Assessment Tool was developed using international good practices in SALW control and guidance from assessment experts. However, it does not replace technical expertise in SALW control nor experience in conducting an assessment. Without these, it cannot ensure the validity and robustness of assessment findings<br>If you are a new user, we recommend that you also take a look at the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"6.1 Overview of use cases.md\" href=\"6.-use-cases/6.1-overview-of-use-cases.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">assessment use cases</a> to understand how to use the Assessment Tool and its functions during an assessment.\nDownload the application file from the [UNODA website].

These have been drafted by SALW experts based on the international good practices contained in MOSAIC. You can design your assessment checklist by searching and selecting relevant assessment criteria from the repository. The repository can be accessed in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"2.1 Overview of the design mode.md\" href=\"2.-design-mode/2.1-overview-of-the-design-mode.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">design mode</a> and is displayed in the left-hand pane. You can hide or reveal the repository of assessment criteria by clicking the directory icon in the menu bar.<br><img src=\"images/pasted-image-20250916133450.png\" target=\"_self\">The following MOSAIC modules are covered by the repository:<br><img src=\"images/pasted-image-20250916133538.png\" target=\"_self\"><br>The repository displays criteria in a tree diagram to help you navigate and select relevant assessment criteria (see <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"2.3 Navigating, searching and filtering the repository of assessment criteria.md\" href=\"2.-design-mode/2.3-navigating,-searching-and-filtering-the-repository-of-assessment-criteria.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">2.3 Navigating, searching and filtering the repository of assessment criteria</a>). The tree diagram organizes the assessment criteria thematically into different levels under categories called nodes.NB: Entries in a tree diagram are called nodes. In this User Guide, nodes describe the tree-diagram equivalent of chapters or folders. I.e., in the repository of assessment criteria, a node contains multiple criteria. A node can also contain more nodes the same way a folder often contains sub-folders.<br>The main nodes correspond to elements of a national SALW control system that can be assessed using the Assessment Tool (e.g., Stockpile management or Marking and record-keeping in the screenshot). Each main node contains subsidiary nodes, which cover a specific subcategory of criteria related to the main node (e.g., the Stockpile management node contains the subsidiary nodes Stockpile composition, Stockpile location parameters etc.). You can choose to assess all of the criteria under a node or just a selection of criteria (see <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"2.4 Adding and removing criteria.md\" href=\"2.-design-mode/2.4-adding-and-removing-criteria.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">2.4 Adding and removing criteria</a>).<br>NB: Whilst the structure resembles the modules and clauses used in MOSAIC, several changes have been made to transform the guidance into assessment criteria. Furthermore, criteria in the repository cannot be changed. However, the Assessment Tool allows you to add <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"2.5 Custom criteria.md\" href=\"2.-design-mode/2.5-custom-criteria.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">custom criteria</a> that you can freely edit.Some criteria in the repository contain subcriteria. The subcriteria are measures that may need to be assessed in order to make a judgement about the implementation of the main criterion. When you select a criterion that contains subcriteria, the subcriteria will automatically be added to the assessment and cannot be removed individually. The User Guide uses the term criteria to refer to both normal criteria and criteria with subcriteria.There are three types of subcriteria.<br><img src=\"images/pasted-image-20250916133712.png\" target=\"_self\">“Nested” criteria function like follow-up questions: in collection mode, if you assess a main criterion as partially implemented or implemented, you will then be prompted to assess a subset of criteria. For instance, if you have established that SALW are marked at the time of confiscation, the Assessment Tool will then ask you to assess whether these markings are in line with the MOSAIC guidance (see screenshots). These criteria are “nested”.In collection mode, the subcriteria will remain greyed out unless you determine that the main criterion is implemented (🟢) or partially implemented (🟡). In this particular example, if a state does not mark confiscated SALW, then there is no need to ask details about the markings.<br><img src=\"images/pasted-image-20250916133826.png\" target=\"_self\">In some cases, the implementation of a criterion depends on the extent to which a number of submeasures are applied. In collection mode, to assess whether the main criterion is implemented, you will need to evaluate these subcriteria. For instance, in order to assess whether the mandate of the National Point of Contact (NPC) is sufficient to fulfil its functions, you will need to assess various aspects of the mandate (e.g., its authority to examine domestic records, to examine international tracing requests etc.).<br><img src=\"images/pasted-image-20250916134003.png\" target=\"_self\">For “And” criteria, all subcriteria must be implemented (🟢) in order for the main criterion to be considered fully implemented. In collection mode, you will not be able to assess the implementation of the main criterion on its own. The Assessment Tool automatically assigns a level of implementation based on your assessment of its subcriteria. In the example below, the Assessment Tool has assigned partially implemented (🟡) to the main criterion (criterion 5) because one of its subcriteria was assessed as implemented (🟢, subcriterion b), one as partially implemented (🟡, subcriterion c) and one as not implemented (🟠, subcriterion a).<br><img src=\"images/pasted-image-20250916134107.png\" target=\"_self\">In this case, just one subcriterion among several needs to be implemented (🟢) for the main criterion to be considered implemented. For instance, MOSAIC provides several options for constructing armoury walls in a sufficiently secure manner. The walls only need to fulfil one of the options to meet the minimum construction requirements of MOSAIC.<br><img src=\"images/pasted-image-20250916134242.png\" target=\"_self\">In collection mode, you will not be able to assess the implementation of the main criterion independently. The Assessment Tool will mark the main criterion as implemented if at least one subcriterion is assessed as implemented. In the example below, the Assessment Tool has marked the main criterion (criterion 3) as implemented (🟢) because the user has assessed one of its subcriteria as being implemented (🟢, subcriterion a).<br><img src=\"images/pasted-image-20250916134347.png\" target=\"_self\"><br>Back to → <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"2.1 Overview of the design mode.md\" href=\"2.-design-mode/2.1-overview-of-the-design-mode.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">2.1 Overview of the design mode</a>; → <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"3.1 Overview of the collection mode.md\" href=\"3.-collection-mode/3.1-overview-of-the-collection-mode.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">3.1 Overview of the collection mode</a>; → <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"1.1 Home.md#List of all functions and features\" href=\"1.-welcome/1.1-home.html#List of all functions and features\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">List of all functions and features</a>; → <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"1.1 Home.md\" href=\"1.-welcome/1.1-home.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">1.1 Home</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"2.2.1 Criteria with subcriteria","level":2,"id":"2.2.1_Criteria_with_subcriteria_0"},{"heading":"\"Nested\" criteria","level":3,"id":"\"Nested\"_criteria_0"},{"heading":"\"And\" criteria","level":3,"id":"\"And\"_criteria_0"},{"heading":"\"Or\" criteria","level":3,"id":"\"Or\"_criteria_0"}],"links":["2.-design-mode/2.1-overview-of-the-design-mode.html","2.-design-mode/2.3-navigating,-searching-and-filtering-the-repository-of-assessment-criteria.html","2.-design-mode/2.4-adding-and-removing-criteria.html","2.-design-mode/2.5-custom-criteria.html","2.-design-mode/2.1-overview-of-the-design-mode.html","3.-collection-mode/3.1-overview-of-the-collection-mode.html","1.-welcome/1.1-home.html#List of all functions and features","1.-welcome/1.1-home.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"2.-design-mode/2.2-repository-of-assessment-criteria.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":["images/pasted-image-20250916133450.png","images/pasted-image-20250916133538.png","images/pasted-image-20250916133712.png","images/pasted-image-20250916133826.png","images/pasted-image-20250916134003.png","images/pasted-image-20250916134107.png","images/pasted-image-20250916134242.png","images/pasted-image-20250916134347.png"],"createdTime":1750170516461,"modifiedTime":1758269802493,"sourceSize":7159,"sourcePath":"2.

In both cases, structuring an assessment into separate parts or splitting it into subchecklists can be useful.For an example illustrating how to use these functions in an assessment, see the use case for <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"6.4 Assessment with multiple teams and data sources.md\" href=\"6.-use-cases/6.4-assessment-with-multiple-teams-and-data-sources.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">assessment with multiple teams and data sources</a>.<br><img src=\"images/pasted-image-20250916210307.png\" target=\"_self\">The Assessment Tool provides three functions for this purpose, each building on the previous one:\nYou can tag assessment criteria (e.g., with Team1 and Team2 in the example above)\nYou can group the checklist by tags (here: Team1 and Team2)\nYou can split the checklist into separate files.\nTags allow you to group and split a checklist. Primarily, the Assessment Tool suggests that you tag assessment criteria by Team Members (i.e., the assessment experts collecting data); or by Agency (i.e., national authorities or experts from whom you want to collect data; the data sources).\nHowever, depending on your assessment, you might decide to use different kinds of tags. For example, the field Team Members could be repurposed to tag criteria by assessment day for a multi-day assessment.Assessment criteria can be tagged using the edit function:\nSelect a criterion or several criteria (using SHIFT or CTRL).\nClick on the pencil icon (🖉) to bring up the “Edit Criterion” window.\n<br><img src=\"images/pasted-image-20250916210914.png\" target=\"_self\"> Add tags in the pop-up dialogue. To add multiple tags, follow a tag with a comma, which allows you to add another tag.\nNB: Tags can only include letters and numbers. Click “Save”. The team member or agency tagged will appear next to the criterion or criteria in the checklist. You can also view all tags of a selected criterion in the criterion info pane on the right-hand side. To remove a tag, select the criterion or criteria and click on the pencil icon (🖉). In the “Edit Criterion” dialogue, hover over the tag to be removed. Your cursor will change to a round cross-out symbol (🚫). Clicking on the tag will remove this tag. Once criteria have been tagged, they can be grouped by these tags.\nAbove the checklist, select the button to the right of the label “Group by”.\nSelect the tags by which you want to group the checklist.\nWhen “None” is selected, criteria will be grouped by thematic sections.\n<br><img src=\"images/pasted-image-20250916210736.png\" target=\"_self\">NB: The grouped view carries across to collection mode. To change the grouped-by view in collection mode, you need to go back to design mode and choose a different group-by option.\nNB: If you tagged two (or more) team members or agencies in one criterion, the grouped view will result in this criterion being displayed twice. Note that, in collection mode, the Assessment Tool only allows one answer per criterion. If a criterion is tagged as both Team 1 and Team 2, entering a value for Team 1 will also change the answer for Team 2 (and vice versa).The main checklist can be split into separate files based on tags (also called subchecklists). As explained above, this might be useful if an assessment involves multiple assessment teams collecting data independently.\nTo create subchecklists, first tag criteria and group the main checklist using the “Group by” function.\nClick the file menu and select “Split”.\nChoose the save folder in the File Explorer window and click select.\nThe subchecklists will be saved in the chosen folder as new .mosaic files that can be opened with the Assessment Tool.\nNB: Criteria that have not been assigned a tag will be saved in a separate file called “Assessment Name_Other”.<br><img src=\"images/pasted-image-20250916211035.png\" target=\"_self\"><br><img src=\"images/img_split2.png\" target=\"_self\"><br>Back to → <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"2.1 Overview of the design mode.md\" href=\"2.-design-mode/2.1-overview-of-the-design-mode.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">2.1 Overview of the design mode</a>; → <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"1.1 Home.md#List of all functions and features\" href=\"1.-welcome/1.1-home.html#List of all functions and features\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">List of all functions and features</a>; → <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"1.1 Home.md\" href=\"1.-welcome/1.1-home.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">1.1 Home</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"2.6.1 Tagging assessment criteria","level":2,"id":"2.6.1_Tagging_assessment_criteria_0"},{"heading":"2.6.2 Grouping a checklist by tags","level":2,"id":"2.6.2_Grouping_a_checklist_by_tags_0"},{"heading":"2.6.3 Splitting a checklist by tags","level":2,"id":"2.6.3_Splitting_a_checklist_by_tags_0"}],"links":["6.-use-cases/6.4-assessment-with-multiple-teams-and-data-sources.html","2.-design-mode/2.1-overview-of-the-design-mode.html","1.-welcome/1.1-home.html#List of all functions and features","1.-welcome/1.1-home.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"2.-design-mode/2.6-tagging,-grouping-and-splitting-a-checklist.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":["images/pasted-image-20250916210307.png","images/pasted-image-20250916210914.png","images/pasted-image-20250916210736.png","images/pasted-image-20250916211035.png","images/img_split2.png"],"createdTime":1750170739489,"modifiedTime":1758272909153,"sourceSize":4450,"sourcePath":"2.

If you are a first-time user, we recommend that you read the use cases to understand how the functions of the Assessment Tool can be applied in an assessment and to get practical guidance for using it in your specific assessment context.The section gives five examples of use cases. The use cases are hypothetical scenarios that illustrate different approaches to conducting a national SALW control assessment using the Assessment Tool. They reflect the different steps and stages you may encounter when conducting an assessment – from design via data collection to analysing and communicating results. The examples provide a walkthrough of how you can use the Assessment Tool to respond to your needs.\n<a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"6.2 Simple assessment.md\" href=\"6.-use-cases/6.2-simple-assessment.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">6.2 Simple assessment</a>: This use case shows how you can design and undertake straightforward assessments using the Assessment Tool’s Design, Collection and Evaluation modes.

They are unlikely to reflect your specific assessment context entirely. Your assessment may encompass several or all of the use cases presented. In this situation, we recommend that you read those cases that are relevant to you.For each use case, you will find a summary of the assessment approach that it illustrates. Each summary is visualized through a flow chart that presents the different steps involved in the use case. The three colour-coded sections of the diagram correspond to the three modes of the Assessment Tool (i.e., Design, Collection and Evaluation).Following the diagram, you are presented with a step-by-step description of the assessment scenario. It places you in a hypothetical situation in order to walk you through the functions of the Assessment Tool that are relevant to that assessment context. For each function, you will find a hyperlink to a detailed explanation of how to use that function in Section 2 “Modes &amp; Functions” of this guide.The examples are based on the general fictional scenario presented in detail below. In summary, the scenario is set in a fictional country, State A, that has recently experienced problems relating to diverted SALW. The government of State A has requested assistance from the Secretariat of the “Regional Organization on Arms Control” to support the National SALW Commission in conducting a self-assessment of State A’s national SALW control system. The goal is to identify options – policy, regulatory and technical – for improving national SALW control.In the scenario examples, different actors (e.g.&nbsp;national regulators and ministries, regional organizations, independent subject matter experts and specialized non-governmental organizations (NGOs)) are shown to fulfil different roles in the fictional assessment. Choosing different entities is intended to represent the variety of stakeholders that can be involved. The inclusion of one entity over another in a particular use case does not mean that the use case only applies to those entities. The roles assigned to each entity in an assessment may vary and will ultimately be determined by national authorities and the assessment context.State A has a small military located under the Ministry of Defence, while the Police Force is part of the Ministry of Interior. The National SALW Commission, under the Ministry of Interior, is the central coordinating mechanism for the control of small arms and light weapons. The Commission draws its members from across government – including the Ministries of Interior, Defence, Health and Education – relevant agencies and prominent NGOs. Five years ago, the Commission established the Central Firearms Registry, a subdivision responsible for maintaining a register of all licit SALW in the country.State A has been an active proponent of the United Nations Programme of Action on Small Arms (PoA) and its International Tracing Instrument (ITI) and is a member state of INTERPOL. It has ratified both the Arms Trade Treaty and the Firearms Protocol of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. Furthermore, State A is member of a regional organization – the Regional Organization on Arms Control – that has a strong mandate to support its member states with practical arms control measures. In its PoA/ITI national reports, State A has frequently requested international assistance to improve its practices on stockpile management, marking and record-keeping, tracing, collection, destruction, and civilian possession of SALW.State A has recently been suffering from a spate of armed violence. Three months ago, the State A Police Force, as part of a wider INTERPOL operation, performed a successful raid on an organized crime group and was able to seize a large cache of illicit SALW.State A authorities have been unable to establish the origins of the illicit SALW with any certainty. There has, nonetheless, been widespread speculation about their source. Some have argued that markings on the seized SALW suggest that they were largely manufactured in a neighbouring state. Some seized SALW match models that were formerly in use by State A’s military and police. All seized SALW were manufactured outside of State A, but it is not clear when, how or by whom the seized SALW were imported.This uncertainty has added to long-standing concerns regarding State A’s SALW tracing system. Regional specialists have warned that consistent tracing of seized SALW has been difficult due to State A’s inconsistent marking practices and incomplete or missing records within the Central Firearms Registry, in particular concerning SALW that were in circulation before the establishment of the Registry. Poor stockpile management may also have been a key enabling factor in the diversion of the seized illicit SALW. Campaign groups have suggested that the episode points to the inadequacy of controls on civilian possession of SALW and have pointed to a lack of effective collection and destruction programmes.State A is considering a range of options for assessing how to strengthen its SALW control in the light of these developments. The assessment options range from desk-based assessments of legislation, regulations and administrative procedures, to visits to physical sites and to interviews and focus groups with key stakeholders, with or without the assistance of international or regional subject matter experts. It is expected that a final evaluation report will be submitted with policy recommendations and options for international cooperation and assistance.The Regional Organization on Arms Control uses MOSAIC as regional good practice for SALW control. While national implementation of MOSAIC is not required, the Organization strongly encourages that national control systems meet the good practices contained within MOSAIC. After consulting with the Organization’s Secretariat, State A decides to use the Assessment Tool to conduct its assessment.<br>Back to → <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"1.1 Home.md\" href=\"1.-welcome/1.1-home.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">1.1 Home</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"6.1.1 How the use cases are structured","level":2,"id":"6.1.1_How_the_use_cases_are_structured_0"},{"heading":"6.1.2 About the scenario examples","level":2,"id":"6.1.2_About_the_scenario_examples_0"},{"heading":"6.1.3 General assessment scenario","level":2,"id":"6.1.3_General_assessment_scenario_0"}],"links":["6.-use-cases/6.2-simple-assessment.html","6.-use-cases/6.3-multi-stage-assessment.html","6.-use-cases/6.4-assessment-with-multiple-teams-and-data-sources.html","6.-use-cases/6.5-assessment-with-multiple-modes-of-data-collection-(computer-and-paper-based-collection).html","6.-use-cases/6.6-repeated-assessments-(progress-monitoring).html","1.-welcome/1.1-home.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"6.-use-cases/6.1-overview-of-use-cases.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750171099986,"modifiedTime":1758268583883,"sourceSize":8958,"sourcePath":"6.

This use case illustrates how to use the Assessment Tool to conduct an assessment with two or more stages. For instance, you might want to first conduct desk research to help you prepare for an on-the-ground or in-country phase of an assessment. Alternatively, you may ask a relevant government department or agency to conduct a preliminary self-assessment, which will then be used to make subsequent data collection more targeted and efficient.In this use case, the preliminary assessment is intended to guide a subsequent, full-scale assessment. In the example, the Assessment Tool and its design and collection functions are used to plan, design and conduct the preliminary assessment. The results of the preliminary assessment are then reviewed using Evaluation mode. This feeds into the design and planning of the full-scale assessment, with targeted and more comprehensive data collection. The results of the full assessment are used to prepare recommendations for action and changes to policies.<br>This use case draws upon the general <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"6.1 Overview of use cases.md#6.1.3 General assessment scenario\" href=\"6.-use-cases/6.1-overview-of-use-cases.html#6.1.3 General assessment scenario\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">fictional scenario</a> of an assessment of the SALW control system in “State A”. Your role would be that of an international technical expert who has been requested to lead the assessment.<br><img src=\"images/img_flow-chart_multi-stage-assm.png\" target=\"_self\">Following the discovery of SALW held by an organized criminal group in State A, the National SALW Commission of State A requests support from the Secretariat of the Regional Organization on Arms Control to improve its SALW stockpile management, including marking and record-keeping systems. The Commission and the Secretariat decide that a complete assessment of State A’s legal, regulatory and operational framework for marking, record-keeping and stockpile management should be conducted to determine what support will be required. The Commission and the Secretariat select an international team of experts to support the government of State A in conducting this assessment. They decide that the team will conduct a joint preliminary assessment with the National SALW Commission to determine gaps and challenges, before conducting a targeted full assessment with on-the-ground data collection.<br>On the basis of the jointly defined scope, the joint assessment team <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"2.4 Adding and removing criteria.md\" href=\"2.-design-mode/2.4-adding-and-removing-criteria.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">selects the relevant assessment criteria</a> using the Assessment Tool’s <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"2.1 Overview of the design mode.md\" href=\"2.-design-mode/2.1-overview-of-the-design-mode.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">design mode</a>. In this context, the team chooses a selection of criteria under the Stockpile management and Marking and record-keeping nodes.<br>Following the selection of assessment criteria, the team conducts the preliminary assessment in consultation with the National SALW Commission, using the Assessment Tool’s <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"3.1 Overview of the collection mode.md\" href=\"3.-collection-mode/3.1-overview-of-the-collection-mode.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">collection mode</a>.

For example, the team is unable to find information about how key control for access to SALW stores is dealt with in all of State A’s storage facilities. By selecting “No data”, they know that they will have to collect data on access to keys in the full-scale assessment.Similarly, the National SALW Commission’s self-assessment informs the team that a new law has been introduced meaning that SALW are to be “marked at the time of their import with import markings”. However, the assessment team points out evidence uncovered during the desk review that suggests that this law has not yet been consistently implemented. They assess the corresponding criterion as “partially implemented” (🟡) and attach a copy of the relevant section of the law. They also use the “Add notes” feature to record their observation and indicate a need to further corroborate the preliminary assessment finding. When the team returns to conduct the full-scale assessment, it will have this information available to guide their data collection.Following the completion of the preliminary assessment, the team of experts reviews the results using the Assessment Tool’s [evaluation mode]. The preliminary assessment draws attention to strengths and areas of concern as well as highlighting where further data collection and research is required. Using this function, the international team of experts is able to identify how to prioritize its subsequent, full-scale assessment (steps 5-8).Using findings from the preliminary assessment, the team plans the second stage of the assessment. This will consist of site visits, targeted interviews and group discussions, and further self-assessments conducted by relevant government authorities. The team makes minor changes to the assessment checklist using design mode, drawing on the conclusions of the preliminary assessment.The team members conduct a targeted, on-the-ground data-collection mission to fill gaps in their existing knowledge. The experts perform site visits, conduct key informant interviews and focus group discussions, and collect further documentary evidence as required.Using collection mode, the team members records evidence found and notes pertaining to their assessment. They adjust the level of implementation of criteria where additional data fills knowledge gaps or allows the assessment team to correct the preliminary assessment.<br>Once all criteria have been assessed, the team uses evaluation mode to review the results. This may also be an opportunity to identify where information is still missing and where follow-up data collection is required (optional step 9 in the flow chart). The results are <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"4.2 Exporting assessment data as a CSV file.md\" href=\"4.-evaluation-mode/4.2-exporting-assessment-data-as-a-csv-file.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">exported as a CSV file</a> to facilitate thorough data analysis.The results of the two assessment stages inform the team’s final written report that it presents to the National SALW Commission and the Secretariat.

The Secretariat selects one regional expert with expertise on stockpile management to conduct the assessment. The regional expert liaises with the National SALW Commission and the Secretariat to define the exact scope of the assessment. It is decided that an assessment will be conducted both on the physical security of weapon-storage locations and on the regulation, standards and framework governing weapon storage. This requires in-person site visits as well as a desk-based assessment of regulations and guidelines.<br>On the basis of this scope, the regional expert plans the assessment.

As a first step, an assessment is conducted using the Assessment Tool to establish a baseline. National authorities then use the findings of this first assessment to formulate options to improve national SALW control and to make requests for international cooperation and assistance. After a certain amount of time, a follow-up assessment is undertaken in order to monitor progress towards implementing measures for the national SALW control system and to determine further options to enhance the national system.In this use case, the Assessment Tool is used to create an assessment checklist that can be used in multiple assessments.

The same assessment checklist is then used after a given amount of time to assess the same criteria in order to determine whether criteria are assessed differently (e.g., green instead of yellow) and where progress has been made. The process can be repeated multiple times using the same assessment checklist.<br>This use case draws upon the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"6.1 Overview of use cases.md#6.1.3 General assessment scenario\" href=\"6.-use-cases/6.1-overview-of-use-cases.html#6.1.3 General assessment scenario\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">general fictional scenario</a> of an assessment of the SALW control system in “State A”. Your role would be that of the assessment team leader, either as an international expert and member of a specialized non-governmental organization (NGO) or as a national expert and member of the National SALW Commission.NB: Assessments always involve a certain level of subjectivity. When comparing assessments made at different time, care thus needs to be taken to determine whether differences in findings reflect actual changes in SALW control or just diverging opinions of assessors.<br><img src=\"images/img_flow-chart_repeated-assessments.png\" target=\"_self\">The Ministry of Interior of State A has identified that inadequate marking, record-keeping and tracing of SALW have hindered investigations into the origins of the illicit SALW seized from an organized criminal group. It convenes the National SALW Commission, which decides to request assistance from the Secretariat of the Regional Organization on Arms Control in assessing State A’s national SALW control system with a view to strengthening policy, legislation and infrastructure. It is agreed that a baseline assessment will be conducted to identify focus areas and make recommendations (steps 2-5). A follow-up assessment is then to be conducted 24 months later to evaluate progress (steps 6-8). A specialized international NGO is selected to support the National SALW Commission in conducting the assessments. The National SALW Commission, the Secretariat and the NGO meet and agree on the scope of the assessment as well as assemble a joint assessment team.<br>On this basis, the joint assessment team plan the baseline assessment using the Assessment Tool’s design mode. They <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"2.4 Adding and removing criteria.md\" href=\"2.-design-mode/2.4-adding-and-removing-criteria.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">select relevant criteria</a> to be assessed from the Marking and record-keeping and Tracing thematic nodes.Following the selection of assessment criteria, the team conducts the baseline assessment of State A’s national SALW control system. Data is collected through desk research, site visits, interviews and a self-assessment conducted by the National SALW Commission. The data is recorded using the Assessment Tool’s collection mode.<br>Upon completion of the data-collection phase, the joint assessment team reviews the results using the Assessment Tool’s <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"4.1 Overview of the evaluation mode.md\" href=\"4.-evaluation-mode/4.1-overview-of-the-evaluation-mode.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">evaluation mode</a>. Having viewed the data visualizations, the joint team notes a lack of implementation regarding practices and regulation relating to marking and domestic tracing operations. The joint team performs further analysis of the results displayed in the summary, and uses the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"4.2 Exporting assessment data as a CSV file.md\" href=\"4.-evaluation-mode/4.2-exporting-assessment-data-as-a-csv-file.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Export CSV function</a> to export the results to a spreadsheet file.The NGO uses the findings of the baseline assessment and its analysis to write an assessment report with policy recommendations. These relate especially to the areas of concern highlighted by the baseline assessment. The report is shared with the National SALW Commission, the Ministry of Interior and the Secretariat. The National SALW Commission proceeds, in collaboration with the Ministry of Interior, to work with the relevant state authorities and departments to act on the policy recommendations. With international assistance, State A undergoes a 24-month national programme to improve its national marking, record-keeping and tracing systems.<br>At the end of the 24-month implementation period, the Ministry of Interior requests the assessment team to conduct a follow-up assessment. The goal of the assessment is to determine the extent of State A’s progress and to re-assess options to improve the national SALW control system. The team uses the Assessment Tool’s design mode to replicate the assessment criteria used in the baseline assessment. Using the file from the baseline assessment, they use the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"5.1 File menu.md#5.1.1 Saving files\" href=\"5.-general-functions/5.1-file-menu.html#5.1.1 Saving files\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Save template function</a> to create a new .mosaic file that contains the same assessment checklist but no assessment data.The team carries out data collection for the selected assessment criteria using collection mode, as with the baseline assessment.Once all data has been collected, the team is able to analyse the results using evaluation mode. Comparing the visualizations, the team notes a marked improvement in “standards applicable to marking” and “marking at the time of import”. Using the “Export CSV” feature, the NGO conducts a more detailed analysis of the improvements in certain criteria. It identifies that the national point of contact for tracing remains understaffed and without a sufficient mandate to fulfil its role.The NGO uses its analysis to produce a final evaluation report that it presents to the National SALW Commission and the Secretariat. This report highlights both the important progress made and the new enhancement options for State A’s national marking and record-keeping systems. The report allows the government of State A and its international partners to refocus their efforts to prevent the diversion of SALW through international cooperation and assistance as well as domestic action on policy and legislation.<br>Back to → <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"6.1 Overview of use cases.md\" href=\"6.-use-cases/6.1-overview-of-use-cases.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">6.1 Overview of use cases</a>; <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"1.1 Home.md\" href=\"1.-welcome/1.1-home.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">1.1 Home</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"6.6.1 Stages of the assessment","level":2,"id":"6.6.1_Stages_of_the_assessment_0"},{"heading":"6.6.2 Scenario example","level":2,"id":"6.6.2_Scenario_example_0"},{"heading":"1.

Why is that?\nCheck whether the criterion is part of an AND- or OR-logic set of subcriteria. For example, an AND-logic criterion might read: “SALW control shall fulfil all of the following.” Also, note that subcriteria are ordered using letters (a, b, c) rather than numbers (1, 2, 3)\n<br>AND- and OR-logic assessment criteria are automatically set based on the assessment of their subordinated criteria.
